NAME
	jdepchk - checks JVM classes for conformance to dependency rules

SYNOPSIS
	jdepchk [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
	Scans class files in dirs, .jar files, or dirs with .jar files for dependencies on other
	classes and verifies the latter against a set of rules.

	-r, --rules FILENAME
		Loads rule definitions from the given file. See below for examples of rule definitions.

	-c, --classes DIRNAME
		Scans .class files in the given directory and all its subdirectories.
		You will typically use this for javac's output dirs.

	-j, --jars DIRNAME
		Scans .jar files in the given directory, then scans all the .class files contained within
		the .jar files found.
		You will typically use this to verify rules against the final result of builds. 

	--show-rules
		Lists all the low-level rules in effect after parsing the rule files. In particular, this
		shows how component-based rules are implemented as low-level rules by JDepChk.

	--show-stats
		Shows information about number of classes inspected, and some other details.
